To initially run the program you open terminal and navigate to the directory where the files are stored, once there, the user types “make clean” in the terminal.  
This deletes previous class files. The user then types “make”, which rebuilds the program files. After the make process has finished, the user types “java Main”, 
this will run the program and get everything started.
